# Node Assessment

### Setup

1. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
2. Create a file called ```server.js```. All of your server code and endpoints will be in this file.
3. Create a file called ```usersCtrl.js```.  In this file you will write all of the functions for your endpoints.
  - Require the ```userData.json``` file in the ```usersCtrl.js``` file.
  - Don't forget to export the functions that you create in the ```usersCtrl.js``` file.

### Import Postman tests

#### A file named ```node_assessment.postman_collection.json``` is inside the ```postman_testing``` folder. We will import this file in postman.

1. Open Postman.
2. In the top left corner, click on the ```Import``` button.
3. Make sure that ```Import File``` is selected / underlined, then click on ```Choose Files```.
4. You will have to navigate to the folder that you cloned this repo in to.
  - You will need to select the ```node_assessment.postman_collection.json``` file (located in the ```postman_testing``` folder).
